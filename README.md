# GeoGym-Tracker - **Under Construction**
Leveraging modern JavaScript ES6+ features, I embraced an object-oriented design approach and achieved advanced DOM manipulation, resulting in a more intuitive user experience. I further enhanced the platform by incorporating an advanced geolocation workout tracker using Leaflet.js, enabling precise plotting of user exercises on interactive maps. Additionally, to offer a seamless user experience, I integrated sophisticated local storage solutions that not only ensure data persistence across browser sessions but also streamline data retrieval processes.
